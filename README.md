FlierGame
=========

Game to catch a flying ball with your computer cam
If you run the game in Eclipse you'll need the JavaCV here https://code.google.com/p/javacv/downloads/detail?name=javacv-0.6-bin.zip
and Jars here https://code.google.com/p/javacv/downloads/detail?name=javacv-0.6-cppjars.zip

Step 1: Select your mitten by clicking on the screen (I clicked my hand, but you could hold up a color paper or something)
Step 2: Move it around to hit the ball

The 'mitten' changes colors just for fun.
